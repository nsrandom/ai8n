# AI8N Workflow Visualizer

A Streamlit-based web interface for visualizing and exploring AI8N workflows.

## Features

- **Workflow Selection**: Browse and select from available workflows in the database
- **Interactive Graph Visualization**: View workflow nodes and connections as an interactive graph
- **Node Details**: Explore individual node properties, parameters, and positions
- **Connection Information**: See how nodes are connected in the workflow
- **Real-time Updates**: Automatically reflects changes in the workflow database

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Streamlit
- Plotly (for graph visualization)
- Pandas (for data handling)
- SQLite database with AI8N workflow data

## Installation

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Ensure you have workflow data in the database:
   ```bash
   # Create some sample workflows
   python data/create_incrementor_workflow.py 3
   ```

## Running the App

### Option 1: Using the launcher script (Recommended)
```bash
python ui/streamlit/run_app.py
```

### Option 2: Direct Streamlit command
```bash
cd /path/to/ai8n
streamlit run ui/streamlit/app.py
```

The app will open in your default web browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Usage

1. **Select a Workflow**: Use the dropdown in the sidebar to choose a workflow
2. **View the Graph**: The main area shows an interactive graph of the workflow
3. **Explore Nodes**: Click on the sidebar to see detailed information about each node
4. **Understand Connections**: View how nodes are connected in the workflow

## Graph Visualization

- **Nodes**: Represented as colored circles with node names
- **Connections**: Shown as arrows between nodes
- **Colors**: Different node types have different colors:
  - ðŸ”´ Trigger (Red)
  - ðŸŸ¢ Command (Teal)
  - ðŸ”µ Constant (Blue)
  - ðŸŸ¡ LLM (Green)
  - ðŸŸ  Conditional (Yellow)
  - ðŸŸ£ Manual (Plum)

## Troubleshooting

- **No workflows found**: Make sure you have created workflows in the database
- **Database connection issues**: Check that `data/ai8n.db` exists and is accessible
- **Import errors**: Ensure you're running from the project root directory

## Development

To modify the UI:

1. Edit `app.py` for main functionality
2. Modify `run_app.py` for launcher behavior
3. Test changes by running the app locally

The app automatically reloads when you make changes to the code.
